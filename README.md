\# PLANT-COMMONS — Nutrient Commons Governance Standard



PLANT-COMMONS is a governance standard about something older than agriculture and more basic than markets:



> When plants that can feed people for free are quietly pushed aside in favor of products that must be bought, that is not “progress.” That is a governance failure.



This repo is not about three “miracle” plants as a sales pitch.  

It is about the pattern that keeps repeating:



\- nutrient-dense plants that grow easily and can be shared locally,  

\- re-framed as weeds, nuisances, or curiosities,  

\- while people are funneled into labor systems just to afford manufactured food.



For v1.0, three plants are used as \*\*canonical examples\*\* of this pattern:



\- Wolffia globosa (Mankai duckweed)  

\- Cyperus esculentus (Chufa / tiger nut)  

\- Moringa oleifera (Moringa, “miracle tree”)



They stand in for a much larger set of “nutrient commons” that have fed humans for millennia.

\## What this standard is for



PLANT-COMMONS is written for:



\- public agencies (agriculture, environment, health),  

\- universities and research institutes,  

\- seed banks and conservation bodies,  

\- companies shaping nutrition guidelines, fortified foods, and supplements,  

\- civil society groups working on food sovereignty and local resilience.



It defines how institutions must speak about, regulate, and design around nutrient-dense plants that:



\- can be grown and shared without corporate intermediaries,  

\- have a track record of feeding humans,  

\- and are being sidelined or rebranded for profit.



This standard:



\- does \*\*not\*\* ban commercial products,  

\- does \*\*not\*\* romanticize any plant as magic,  

\- does \*\*not\*\* name individual companies or families.



It documents behaviors:



\- erasure via “weed” labels,  

\- quiet replacement of free food with wage-bound food,  

\- marketing that sells people back what their ancestors already had.

\## What’s in this repo



\- \*\*Governance standard (normative)\*\*  

&nbsp; `docs/PLANT\_COMMONS\_GOVERNANCE\_v1.0.md`  

&nbsp; Binding rules and obligations. Defines “plant commons,” structural harm, and what public agencies, researchers, companies, and communities must and must not do.



\- \*\*Background notes (non-normative)\*\*  

&nbsp; `docs/PLANT\_COMMONS\_BACKGROUND\_NOTES.md`  

&nbsp; Context and references for the example plants. Explains why they were chosen and what structural patterns they reveal.



\- \*\*Hash log\*\*  

&nbsp; `meta/HASHES.md`  

&nbsp; A simple record of SHA-256 hashes for canonical documents in this repo.



\- \*\*Notarization log\*\*  

&nbsp; `meta/NOTARIZATION.md`  

&nbsp; A log for any external timestamp or notarization events tied to those hashes.



`README.md` is not part of the hash surface and may change for clarity without affecting canonical documents.

\## Position in the SPARK-NITT governance stack



PLANT-COMMONS sits at the “soil layer” of your governance stack:



\- Below \*\*CTGS\*\* (consumer transparency)  

\- Beside \*\*HRIS\*\* (coherence-centered refusal)  

\- Below future \*\*PCA\*\* governance (planetary continuity)



It exists to remind future standards that:



\- governance is not only about data, identity, or AI,  

\- but also about who is allowed to eat well from the land without paying rent to someone else.



This standard can be cited anywhere you need a clear sentence that says:



> “If you are going to call life-sustaining plants weeds, show your work — and show respect for the people they have fed.”
