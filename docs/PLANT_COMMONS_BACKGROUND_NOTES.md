\# PLANT-COMMONS Background Notes (Non-Normative)



This document is informative, not binding.  

It gives context for the example plants used in PLANT-COMMONS v1.0 and shows how they illustrate the wider pattern this standard is about.



\## Wolffia globosa (Mankai)



\- Tiny aquatic plant (“duckweed”) investigated as a human food source.

\- Studies report high protein and measurable vitamin B12 content when grown with its natural microbial partners.

\- Much of the B12 is produced by associated bacteria, and bioavailability for humans is still being studied.

\- Used in some diet interventions as a plant-based protein and B12 source.



Key idea: Wolffia is not magic, but it is a compact, fast-growing nutrient source that deserves serious, transparent evaluation—not dismissal as pond scum or weed by default.



\## Cyperus esculentus (Chufa / Tiger Nut)



\- Sedge with edible tubers used historically across multiple regions.

\- Tubers contain fats, carbohydrates, fiber, and some protein.

\- Used for snacks, beverages (e.g., horchata), flours, and oil.

\- Frequently classified as a weed or invasive in industrial systems while being a valued food crop in others.



Key idea: the same species should not be treated as trash in one context and luxury health food in another without honest explanation.



\## Moringa oleifera (Moringa / “Miracle Tree”)



\- Drought-hardy tree used widely in traditional diets.

\- Leaves and pods contain vitamins, minerals, and protein.

\- Modern work highlights potential health benefits; safe use still depends on dose, preparation, and context.

\- Often promoted as a “miracle” product in supplement markets while communities that have always used it receive little structural support.



Key idea: Moringa is not a magic cure, but it is a robust, locally-propagated nutrition source that deserves infrastructure support, not only glossy marketing.



\## Structural Patterns to Watch



The plants above illustrate a broader pattern:



\- Nutrient-dense, locally manageable plants are under-researched compared to highly profitable products.

\- Weed and nuisance labels can be applied in ways that discourage local food autonomy.

\- “Superfood” branding can erase the people and practices that carried these plants through time.



PLANT-COMMONS does not romanticize plants or deny ecological risk.  

It demands that risk and benefit be evaluated honestly, in the open, with food security and sovereignty on the same page as invasive-species checklists.
