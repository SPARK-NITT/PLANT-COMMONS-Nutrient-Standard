# PLANT-COMMONS Background Notes (Non-Normative)

This document is informative, not binding.  
It gives context for the example plants used in PLANT-COMMONS v1.0 and shows how they illustrate the wider pattern this standard is about.

## Wolffia globosa (Mankai / Asian watermeal)

Wolffia globosa is part of the duckweed family and is sometimes described as:

- the world’s smallest flowering plant,  
- a rootless, stemless “lens” of tissue floating on water,  
- and one of the fastest-growing higher plants ever measured. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  

Under good conditions, duckweeds can **double their biomass within roughly 16–48 hours**, and Wolffia species are at the top of that curve. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

### Nutritional profile (what is known)

Across the duckweed/Wolffia literature and trials:

- **High protein:** Dry matter protein for Wolffia species is often reported in the **30–45% range**, with some cultivars/formulations claiming up to ~40–48%. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  
- **Comparable to animal protein on paper:** Duckweed protein levels and quality have been reported as comparable to common animal sources when measured per dry weight, and studies note that duckweeds contain **all essential amino acids at levels close to WHO adult requirements**. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- **Fatty acids and micronutrients:** Wolffia provides omega-3 fatty acids (ALA), polyunsaturated fatty acids, iron, calcium, magnesium, and various vitamins and antioxidants. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

Taken together, this means Wolffia can act as a **complete plant-based protein source on paper**, and has been proposed as a way to **reduce reliance on external supplementation** in some plant-based diets—though long-term human data are still limited and medical/nutritional guidance remains important. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  

### Growth efficiency and yield

Because it grows as a thin floating layer rather than a bulky stem/leaf system, Wolffia can dedicate most of its structure to photosynthetic tissue:

- Duckweed biomass yields of **20–40 tonnes dry matter per hectare per year** have been reported in favourable setups, with protein yields that **significantly exceed soybean** on the same land area. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
- Some estimates frame duckweed as producing **several-fold more protein per hectare** than conventional crops, purely because of rapid growth and frequent harvests. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

This is why Wolffia is often described as a **“highly efficient protein factory”**: fast doubling, high protein percentage, and continuous harvest potential.

### Cultivation characteristics

Key practical features for PLANT-COMMONS purposes:

- Grows on water rather than soil, in shallow ponds or controlled tanks.  
- Can be cultivated in nutrient-rich waste streams (e.g., some types of wastewater) or in closed recirculating systems, reducing pressure on arable land if managed correctly. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- Requires nutrients, but **does not require conventional plough-and-field agriculture**, pesticides, or heavy mechanization when done at small scale.

Duckweed’s simple structure (no obvious stems, leaves, or deep roots) makes it extremely responsive to light and dissolved nutrients, which is part of what drives its growth speed.

### Water remediation and “waste” loops

Duckweed species, including Wolffia relatives:

- are widely studied for **removal of nitrogen and phosphorus** from polluted water,  
- can accumulate or transform **heavy metals and organic contaminants**, and  
- have shown capacity to reduce concentrations of some **pharmaceutical residues** in controlled systems. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  

This creates a double role:

1. As a **biological filtration system** for contaminated or nutrient-rich water.
2. As a **biomass source** that can be used (with appropriate safeguards) for animal feed or further processing.

Critics point out that current industrial practice sometimes runs a loop where:

- fertilizers drive nutrient runoff and algal/duckweed blooms,  
- chemical herbicides are then sold to clear that growth,  
- and the cycle repeats as nutrients re-enter the water.

PLANT-COMMONS does not try to solve that entire industrial loop, but it does insist that **plants capable of feeding people should not be dismissed as “weeds” in the same breath that their biomass is treated as a nuisance byproducts of fertiliser regimes.**

### Autonomy and decentralization

Because Wolffia:

- can be grown in small, shallow water bodies,  
- has very high protein density,  
- and can be harvested with simple tools,

it has been proposed in research and commentary as a candidate for:

- **household or community-scale ponds** providing steady protein and micronutrients,  
- **integrated systems** where it both cleans animal-manure lagoons and becomes a high-protein animal feed,  
- and **local “nutrient commons”** where families are less dependent on distant industrial feed or food chains. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}  

This does not mean Wolffia alone can provide “complete nutritional autonomy” for all contexts—but it does mean that **decentralized cultivation can materially shift how much a community depends on industrial inputs for basic protein and micronutrients.**

### Space and extreme environments

Because of its:

- rapid growth,  
- compact form,  
- high protein content, and  
- suitability for controlled aquatic systems,

Wolffia globosa has been investigated as a candidate crop for **space agriculture and bioregenerative life support systems** (e.g., ESA and NASA-linked studies on altered gravity and closed-loop phytoremediation units). :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  

For PLANT-COMMONS, the main point is not the space story; it is the **contrast**:

- A plant interesting enough for space agencies to study as a closed-loop food + water-cleanup candidate  
- can simultaneously be treated as **pond scum or a nuisance** in public-facing narratives on Earth.

That gap—between what the species can do and how it is framed—is exactly the kind of structural distortion this standard is meant to surface.

## Cyperus esculentus (Chufa / Tiger Nut)

- Sedge with edible tubers used historically across multiple regions.
- Tubers contain fats, carbohydrates, fiber, and some protein.
- Used for snacks, beverages (e.g., horchata), flours, and oil.
- Frequently classified as a weed or invasive in industrial systems while being a valued food crop in others.

Key idea: the same species should not be treated as trash in one context and luxury health food in another without honest explanation.

## Moringa oleifera (Moringa / “Miracle Tree”)

- Drought-hardy tree used widely in traditional diets.
- Leaves and pods contain vitamins, minerals, and protein.
- Modern work highlights potential health benefits; safe use still depends on dose, preparation, and context.
- Often promoted as a “miracle” product in supplement markets while communities that have always used it receive little structural support.

Key idea: Moringa is not a magic cure, but it is a robust, locally propagated nutrition source that deserves infrastructure support, not only glossy marketing.

## Structural Patterns to Watch

The plants above illustrate a broader pattern:

- Nutrient-dense, locally manageable plants are under-researched compared to highly profitable products.
- Weed and nuisance labels can be applied in ways that discourage local food autonomy.
- “Superfood” branding can erase the people and practices that carried these plants through time.
- Industrial input cycles (fertilizers, herbicides, proprietary formulations) can create recurring markets that treat freely-growing plants as problems rather than assets.

PLANT-COMMONS does not romanticize plants or deny ecological risk.  
It demands that risk and benefit be evaluated honestly, in the open, with food security and sovereignty on the same page as invasive-species checklists and commercial interests.
