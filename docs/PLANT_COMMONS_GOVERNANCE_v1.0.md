\# PLANT-COMMONS Governance Standard v1.0



\## 0. Purpose and Scope



PLANT-COMMONS defines how institutions must treat nutrient-dense, freely-growable plants that have historically fed humans, but are now:



\- labeled as weeds or nuisances,

\- sidelined in official nutrition guidance,

\- or sold back as expensive “superfoods” through commercial chains.



The standard is written for:



\- public agencies (agriculture, environment, health),

\- universities and research institutes,

\- seed banks and conservation bodies,

\- companies that influence food systems (fortified foods, supplements, agribusiness),

\- civil society organizations working on food sovereignty.



v1.0 uses three plants as \*\*canonical examples\*\*, not as a closed set:



\- \*\*Wolffia globosa\*\* (Mankai duckweed)  

\- \*\*Cyperus esculentus\*\* (Chufa / tiger nut)  

\- \*\*Moringa oleifera\*\* (Moringa)



These illustrate a larger “plant commons” that can sustain human life yet are treated as obstacles or luxury products.



The goal is not to ban commercial food.  

The goal is to expose and correct the pattern where governance aligns with monetization over nutrition and local autonomy.

\## 1. Problem Statement



Across history, plants like Wolffia, Chufa, and Moringa have:



\- bridged hunger seasons,

\- sustained households and villages without centralized supply chains,

\- carried dense nutrition in conditions where cash crops failed.



Modern systems have allowed them to become:



\- “weeds” on one page and “premium health products” on another,

\- absent or footnoted in official dietary guidance,

\- raw material for products priced far above local reach.



This standard describes a structural pattern:



1\. Plants that feed people without requiring branded inputs or complex logistics threaten established profit models.

2\. The easiest way to control them is:

&nbsp;  - classify them as weeds or invasives,

&nbsp;  - or reframe them as boutique “superfoods” disconnected from their commons role.

3\. Policy, research funding, and public messaging drift toward that gravity unless explicitly checked.



PLANT-COMMONS is that check.

\## 2. Key Definitions



\### 2.1 Plant Commons



A plant belongs to the \*\*plant commons\*\* if it:



\- can provide meaningful calories and/or micronutrients,

\- can be propagated and grown by non-experts at household or community scale,

\- has a documented history of human use as food,

\- can be shared without requiring proprietary intermediaries.



For v1.0, PLANT-COMMONS focuses on:



\- \*\*Wolffia globosa\*\* — a small aquatic plant studied for high protein content and vitamin B12 associated with its microbial community.

\- \*\*Cyperus esculentus\*\* — a sedge whose tubers have been eaten for centuries, rich in fats, fiber, and carbohydrates.

\- \*\*Moringa oleifera\*\* — a drought-tolerant tree with leaves and pods used as food in many traditional diets.



Future versions may add additional species that meet the criteria above.



\### 2.2 Weed Label



Any classification, regulation, or guidance that:



\- instructs or incentivizes removal, eradication, or suppression of a plant, or

\- prohibits cultivation outside tightly controlled circumstances,



without a transparent, evidence-based justification that includes:



\- ecological impact (invasiveness, biodiversity risk),

\- food security impact (loss of local nutrition capacity),

\- cultural and historical use,

\- viable alternatives for equivalent nutrition.



\### 2.3 Structural Harm



Harm that arises from repeated institutional patterns rather than a single decision, including:



\- systematically underfunding or neglecting research on non-patentable plants,

\- defaulting to fortified, branded products in public programs while ignoring freely-growable options,

\- messaging that frames traditional food plants as “backwards” or “unsafe” to justify replacement.



PLANT-COMMONS treats structural harm as a governance failure that must be named and corrected.

\## 3. Governance Principles



\### Principle 1 — Nutrient Reality First



Public communication and policy must not distort or suppress basic facts about what a plant can provide.



For any plant in the commons:



\- Nutritional content (with ranges and uncertainties) shall be presented honestly.

\- Official guidance shall state where the plant can reasonably support a diet, and where it cannot.

\- Plants shall not be downplayed to protect sales of commercial products when evidence supports their utility.



\### Principle 2 — Weed Labels Require Evidence



For plants in the commons:



\- Weed, nuisance, or eradication labels shall not be applied without:

&nbsp; - a clear ecological rationale, and

&nbsp; - an explicit comparison between ecological risk and food security benefit.



\- Conflict-of-interest disclosures are required where:

&nbsp; - agencies or advisers have ties to products that compete with the plant’s role as food,

&nbsp; - or where eradication policies align conveniently with commercial cropping interests.



If a plant that can feed people is to be suppressed, the justification must be ecological and food-security aware, not based on discomfort with local autonomy.



\### Principle 3 — Commons Access by Default



Where legally and ecologically safe:



\- Public institutions should maintain accessible seed or propagule stocks for plant-commons species.

\- Practical growing and preparation guidance should be made publicly available without paywalls.

\- Public programs promoting fortified foods should be at least as proactive in enabling access to commons plants that can be grown locally.



\### Principle 4 — Honest “Superfood” Framing



For commercial products based on plant-commons species:



\- Marketing shall acknowledge existing cultural and historical uses.

\- Products shall not imply that proprietary processing is the only safe way to consume the plant if basic preparation is sufficient for safety.

\- Claims shall not erase the fact that the underlying plant is capable of feeding people outside the product context.



The value added may be convenience, storage, or formulation—not discovery of the plant’s worth.



\### Principle 5 — Research Without Erasure



Research institutions studying plant-commons species shall:



\- report limitations and negative results openly,

\- distinguish clearly between:

&nbsp; - failures of system design (e.g., contamination control),

&nbsp; - and inherent plant risks or limits,

\- avoid blanket statements that dismiss entire species based on narrow use cases.

\## 4. Obligations by Actor



\### 4.1 Public Agencies



Public agencies (agriculture, environment, health, development) shall:



\- avoid designating plant-commons species as weeds or targets for eradication without:

&nbsp; - documented ecological assessment, and

&nbsp; - explicit food security impact analysis.



\- include plant-commons species as options in relevant:

&nbsp; - nutrition and resilience guidance,

&nbsp; - climate adaptation and recovery planning,

&nbsp; where evidence supports their use.



\- publish at least one neutral, non-commercial explainer per commons species present in their jurisdiction, in accessible language.



\### 4.2 Research Institutions



Research institutions shall:



\- treat plant-commons species as legitimate subjects for food security and public health research, not curiosities,

\- disclose funding sources and potential conflicts of interest clearly in all outputs,

\- publish both successful and failed trials in formats that communities and practitioners can understand.



\### 4.3 Companies and Brands



Companies and brands that sell products derived from plant-commons species shall:



\- acknowledge traditional and contemporary uses in public materials where relevant,

\- avoid suggesting that communities cannot safely grow or use the plant itself without the company’s intervention, unless backed by clear evidence,

\- refrain from lobbying for weed designations or restrictive regulations that suppress non-commercial cultivation of plant-commons species.



\### 4.4 Civil Society and Communities



Civil society organizations and communities are encouraged to:



\- document and share local knowledge on cultivation, preparation, and risks of plant-commons species,

\- build gardens, ponds, and plots where these plants can be grown and observed in practice, where ecologically safe,

\- challenge policies that criminalize or stigmatize cultivation without strong, transparent ecological justification.

\## 5. Implementation Notes



\### 5.1 Regional Variation and Ecological Care



PLANT-COMMONS does not mandate introducing species into unsuitable ecosystems.



Instead, it requires that when plant-commons species:



\- are already present, or  

\- have a history of use in a region,



decisions to suppress or eradicate them:



\- are not taken by default,

\- involve affected communities,

\- weigh food autonomy alongside ecological risk.



\### 5.2 Evidence and Uncertainty



Guidance under PLANT-COMMONS shall:



\- draw on peer-reviewed work where available,

\- clearly communicate uncertainty and open questions (e.g., bioavailability, interactions),

\- avoid both hype (“miracle cure”) and blanket dismissal.



Where evidence is incomplete, that fact must be stated plainly.



\### 5.3 Compatibility with Existing Law



PLANT-COMMONS does not override existing environmental protection or invasive species law.



It requires that:



\- those laws be applied transparently,

\- trade-offs be stated, not implied,

\- and decisions avoid quietly privileging commercial supply chains over local food capacity.

\## 6. Versioning and Extension



v1.0 is narrow by design:



\- a small set of example plants,

\- a single core demand:



> Do not erase, criminalize, or quietly sideline plants that can keep people alive, without showing your work and respecting the people they have already fed.



Future versions may:



\- add further plant-commons species,

\- introduce data standards for nutritional claims and weed designations,

\- link formally into higher-level governance such as planetary continuity and civic oversight standards.



Until then, this standard may be cited wherever institutions need a reminder that:



\- food sovereignty is not only about land and supply chains,  

\- but also about whether people are allowed to keep and grow the plants that have always sustained them.
